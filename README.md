Yfie's first pledge mining + Dao lending + anchoring stable currency

Yfie pledge mining DAPP was officially launched, and yfie upgraded and optimized yfi's Dao governance scheme.



The stable currency ethe (1:1) for anchoring eth is introduced. The issuance of eth is related to the number of eth stored in smart contracts.



Access method 1: eth



Anyone can deposit eth into the smart contract to get the eth. It is also the only way to obtain the ethe stable token.



Access method 2: yfie



Mining acquisition method: when depositing yfie, 50% of the total number of wallets can be deposited into the mine pool for mining, and the corresponding 50% yfie will be converted into ethe according to the exchange ratio between yfie and eth, which is similar to the lending system of mortgage yfie lending ethe. In the future, ethe can be converted into yfie and a variety of main currency.



Yfie's initial mining revenue is fixed at 0.5% per day, with an increase of 0.01% for every 24 hours of mining, and the maximum daily income is 1%. If you withdraw from mining, the revenue will be calculated from 0.5% per day, and the mining pool is limited to 22000 pieces. When you quit mining, you need to return the ethe or eth to get back the mining and mining income.



After yfiesawp goes online, ethe will be launched as the transaction absenteeism fee of the platform!
